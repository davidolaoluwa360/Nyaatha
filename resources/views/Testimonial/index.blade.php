                <span class='tesfiernamebold'>John Kan’gethe</span>
                <p>My name is John Kang’ethe, a third-year student at Kenyatta University,
                    pursuing a degree course in Community Resource Management and Extension.
                    In 2002, mu parents broke up, and my mother left us and went to Tanzania,
                    where she was. My siblings and I were issued under the care of our father,
                    who was an alcoholic. Alcoholism had made him quarrel with friends and neighbours
                    because he could not have control over himself. Despite this, I continued with my
                     education until I reached class three, and things started heading south.
                     My father became worse, and all his money was going to alcohol. In 2005,
                     my father became unbearable as he could go to work and come in the evening
                     drunk demanding food, yet had not left any money to buy food. Sometimes my
                     father would request me to assist him in the fruit vendor business after school.
                     One day I did not make it to town to help him, and when he came in the evening,
                     he was furious and beat me. I could not take it anymore, and I ran away from home.
                     After a week, he found me in town and took me back home and gave me a thorough beating.
                     I stayed home for a month; then I ran away again because of the continuous beatings when
                     he subjected me to when he was drunk.</p>
                     <p>After a month and a half in the streets collecting scrap metal, my father caught up with
                         me again. This time he took me to a police station where I was punished. From there,
                         we went home, and I continued with my education normally. At the end of March, I ran
                         away again and went to Eastleigh. In Eastleigh, I stayed there until January 2006 when
                         my friends came and informed me that they found a place they could be helped go back to
                        school. For me, I didn’t see the importance of going back to school as the life in
                        the streets was so comfortable and relaxing. Still, after persuasion from my friends,
                        I joined them, and we were delivered to Kwetu Home of Peace for rehabilitation.
                        After six months, we graduated and went to the main centre, where I continued with my
                        rehabilitation process before starting attending school. In 2007, I joined class four
                        in Mitumba primary school.</p>
                    <p>In 2008, I was transferred to Lang’ata primary school. In the same year, I lost my father.
                        This was a tough moment as I was supposed to be reintegrated back home. Luckily,
                        I was offered a scholarship and transferred to All Saints Cathedral Primary School, Madaraka.
                        I continued with my education here until I did my K.C.P.E. in 2011 and managed to get 389 marks.
                        In 2012 I joined Aquinas High school, and by the end of the four years, I managed to get an A- which
                        enabled me to secure a place in Kenyatta University. Through the sponsorship of Nyaatha, I am in now
                        3 rd year. I thank Nyaatha for supporting my university education.</p>

                <span class='tesfiernamebold'>Moses Njeru</span>
                <p>My name is Moses Njeru, one of the Kwetu Home of Peace reformed old boys.
                    I was rescued from the harsh streets of Nairobi by a social worker from Kwetu
                    when I was very desperate and had lost the meaning of life. I was starving and
                    malnourished. After being housed in Kwetu, hope in life came back, and I
                    experienced love and happiness once again. I was taken to school did well
                    and was able to join high school and performed well. There was a challenge of
                    entering college. However, as the support of the Nyaatha Foundation had already
                    reintegrated me, I was able to join college where I did a certificate in Automotive
                    Technology. I appreciate the help and pray for God’s blessing upon the Foundation as
                    it continues to support many vulnerable youths with exceptional talents in the society.</p>

                    <p>My encounter with sponsorship,</p>
                    <p>It all started way back in 2003 when I met Jenny and her sister Sue
                    while they were visiting the Assumption Sisters in Mokwo, a village on the outskirts
                    of Eldoret.</p>
                    <p>Sr. Leoninda, the Sr. In charge of Assumption sisters of Eldoret at the time she
                    gave out my story to Jenny and her sister Susan, that “Elicah lost her mother in 2000,
                    and her father had remarried and neglected Elicah. Elicah had completed her secondary
                    school education and had nowhere to stay. She went to work as house help for the Sisters
                    in order to get where to stay, the sisters were trying to help her were necessary”.</p>
                    <p>In the course of this conversation, Elicah expressed her desire to go back to school
                    Jenny and Susan told her they will see what to do when they return home</p>
                    <p>In 2004, sisters told me good news to go and enrolled for bachelor’s Degree at
                    Masinde Mulir University of Science and Technology for physics and mathematics.
                    In 2008, I graduated with 2 nd class honor upper division.</p>
                    <p>In2009, again I expressed the desire to pursue a Masters degree, again Jenny accepted
                     and I enrolled in the same University and graduated with Masters in Physics. We kept In
                     touch with Jenny</p>
                     <p>One day I was invited for an interview to teach at the university and I was
                     encouraged to enroll for PHD program.i didn’t have enough money since I was even
                     not employed yet. I shared this story with Jenny and she said“ why not” I could not
                     believed what was happening to me. From house help now to PHD student wow!! I begun my
                     PHD studies at Kenyatta University in 2016.</p>
                     <p>I am hoping to defend my thesis and graduate as a Doctor of Physics in July 2020</p>
                     <p>Thank you Jenny for being the ‘focal point’ as we call it in Physics.
                     Thank you Assumption Sisters of Eldoret for accepting me and believing in me.
                     To all my friends in USA, I am humbled.</p>

                     mentally abnormal, my father is herding sheep at the church and my family is

                    situation, she can do some work and can earn like ksh. 200 shilling per day. I remember
                    vividly just like it was yesterday when I was send home by our teacher for school fees,
                    we stayed for 2month when we went back to school, I found my class are revising for the
                    end term exams. I manage to sit for the exam since my grandmother had talked to the
                     teacher to allow us to do exams. One day as I was coming from school, I found an
                      Assumption sister, she greeted me and I felt happy I managed to share our situation

                    <p>I was rescued from the streets in the year 2012, underwent rehabilitation
                        and joined school while in class 6. I learnt the whole of primary school in
                        Ruai Main Center. I then was reintegrated and went back home, where I studied
                        from form one to form three. There were so many challenges in terms of school fees.
                        I came back to Kwetu and presented my issues to Sister Angela and Sister Caroline.
                        They listened to me, and I was taken back to school in Thuura Boy’s High School under
                         the sponsorship of Nyaatha Fund. I am learning freely in form three.</p>

                        I had no one in my family that could take me to high school. By the help of Nyaatha,
                        I was lucky to join the school. For the last one and half years, my school fees have
                        been catered for on time. I sincerely appreciate that I have never been chased out of
                        school because of fees. May God bless the work of Nyaatha. I promise to work smart and
                        hard.</p>

                        you for the support you have shown to me since I started my high school.
                        I did my class eight in 2006 where I got 290 marks at Queen of Peace Educational
                        Centre in Ruai. In 2017, Sister Eunice gave me shopping for joining secondary at
                         Kalawa Boys’ High School in Makueni where she took the effort of paying for my
                         school fees. In the first term, I scored C plain, second term C minus and third
                         term D+. I did not perform well, but I worked hard to achieve my goals.
                         In January 2018, Sister Caroline Ngatia knew that I was not performing well and
                         transferred me to Thuura Boys’ in Meru where I am working so hard. I got C- in
                         mid-term and C plain at the end of the first term. I am working on it. I am thanking
                         you for your support and may God continue to add more and more so that you can help
                         others.</p>
