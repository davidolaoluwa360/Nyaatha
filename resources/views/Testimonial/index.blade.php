                <span class='tesfiernamebold'>John Kan’gethe</span>
                <p>My name is John Kang’ethe, a third-year student at Kenyatta University,
                    pursuing a degree course in Community Resource Management and Extension.
                    In 2002, mu parents broke up, and my mother left us and went to Tanzania,
                    where she was. My siblings and I were issued under the care of our father,
                    who was an alcoholic. Alcoholism had made him quarrel with friends and neighbours
                    because he could not have control over himself. Despite this, I continued with my
                     education until I reached class three, and things started heading south.
                     My father became worse, and all his money was going to alcohol. In 2005,
                     my father became unbearable as he could go to work and come in the evening
                     drunk demanding food, yet had not left any money to buy food. Sometimes my
                     father would request me to assist him in the fruit vendor business after school.
                     One day I did not make it to town to help him, and when he came in the evening,
                     he was furious and beat me. I could not take it anymore, and I ran away from home.
                     After a week, he found me in town and took me back home and gave me a thorough beating.
                     I stayed home for a month; then I ran away again because of the continuous beatings when
                     he subjected me to when he was drunk.</p>
                     <p>After a month and a half in the streets collecting scrap metal, my father caught up with
                         me again. This time he took me to a police station where I was punished. From there,
                         we went home, and I continued with my education normally. At the end of March, I ran
                         away again and went to Eastleigh. In Eastleigh, I stayed there until January 2006 when
                         my friends came and informed me that they found a place they could be helped go back to
                        school. For me, I didn’t see the importance of going back to school as the life in
                        the streets was so comfortable and relaxing. Still, after persuasion from my friends,
                        I joined them, and we were delivered to Kwetu Home of Peace for rehabilitation.
                        After six months, we graduated and went to the main centre, where I continued with my
                        rehabilitation process before starting attending school. In 2007, I joined class four
                        in Mitumba primary school.</p>
                    <p>In 2008, I was transferred to Lang’ata primary school. In the same year, I lost my father.
                        This was a tough moment as I was supposed to be reintegrated back home. Luckily,
                        I was offered a scholarship and transferred to All Saints Cathedral Primary School, Madaraka.
                        I continued with my education here until I did my K.C.P.E. in 2011 and managed to get 389 marks.
                        In 2012 I joined Aquinas High school, and by the end of the four years, I managed to get an A- which
                        enabled me to secure a place in Kenyatta University. Through the sponsorship of Nyaatha, I am in now
                        3 rd year. I thank Nyaatha for supporting my university education.</p>

                <p>My name is Moses Njeru, one of the Kwetu Home of Peace reformed old boys.
                    I was rescued from the harsh streets of Nairobi by a social worker from Kwetu
                    when I was very desperate and had lost the meaning of life. I was starving and
                    malnourished. After being housed in Kwetu, hope in life came back, and I
                    experienced love and happiness once again. I was taken to school did well
                    and was able to join high school and performed well. There was a challenge of
                    entering college. However, as the support of the Nyaatha Foundation had already
                    reintegrated me, I was able to join college where I did a certificate in Automotive
                    Technology. I appreciate the help and pray for God’s blessing upon the Foundation as
                    it continues to support many vulnerable youths with exceptional talents in the society.</p>

                    <p>I was rescued from the streets in the year 2012, underwent rehabilitation
                        and joined school while in class 6. I learnt the whole of primary school in
                        Ruai Main Center. I then was reintegrated and went back home, where I studied
                        from form one to form three. There were so many challenges in terms of school fees.
                        I came back to Kwetu and presented my issues to Sister Angela and Sister Caroline.
                        They listened to me, and I was taken back to school in Thuura Boy’s High School under
                         the sponsorship of Nyaatha Fund. I am learning freely in form three.</p>

                    <p>I went through rehabilitation for two years during my primary school.
                        In class 8 final exams, I managed to score a good mark was desperate since
                        I had no one in my family that could take me to high school. By the help of Nyaatha,
                        I was lucky to join the school. For the last one and half years, my school fees have
                        been catered for on time. I sincerely appreciate that I have never been chased out of
                        school because of fees. May God bless the work of Nyaatha. I promise to work smart and
                        hard.</p>

                    <p>I am Delvis Kabwoya from Kwetu Home of Peace, and I would like to congratulate
                        you for the support you have shown to me since I started my high school.
                        I did my class eight in 2006 where I got 290 marks at Queen of Peace Educational
                        Centre in Ruai. In 2017, Sister Eunice gave me shopping for joining secondary at
                         Kalawa Boys’ High School in Makueni where she took the effort of paying for my
                         school fees. In the first term, I scored C plain, second term C minus and third
                         term D+. I did not perform well, but I worked hard to achieve my goals.
                         In January 2018, Sister Caroline Ngatia knew that I was not performing well and
                         transferred me to Thuura Boys’ in Meru where I am working so hard. I got C- in
                         mid-term and C plain at the end of the first term. I am working on it. I am thanking
                         you for your support and may God continue to add more and more so that you can help
                         others.</p>
