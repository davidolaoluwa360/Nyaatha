                <h1>Who We Serve</h1>
                <p>The Assumption Sisters Of Eldoret (Nyaatha Foundation) have worked with the street program for several years
                     however the Nyaatha is the initiative of the assumption sisters of Eldoret
                     to improve the lives of disadvantaged children/young people.</p>

                <p>The experience of working with this program is that street children have
                     the potential of being productive in society if supported.
                      The life of the young people in our community has been so distracted that leading
                      into the school dropout and even some have never gone to school.</p>

                <p>The social problems have contributed towards children forming bad groups in the society, e.g. drug abuse,
                    immorality and theft cases not only among the street children but also children
                    from an impoverished background.</p>

                    <h1>A.S.E. Nyaatha Education Endowent</h1>
                    <p>Majority of the people in the communities we serve live below the poverty line.
                        They only get what is barely sufficient for their daily survival, which has contributed
                         to the organization to go extra miles in also looking food for the children who
                          are malnourished in the community.</p>

                    <p>The organization move from one company/organizations to another searching for
                        the support of food, shelter and finally education support, not only companies
                         but also from good wishers.</p>

                    <h1>Target Groups</h1>
                    <p>Most of the young people we meet both in church, on the streets and in the community are unable
                        to meet their educational needs and personal effects. The majority of the populations we serve
                        are small scale farmers and also people who affected by tribal clashes during post-election violence
                        that contributed many children being left by their parents. Whose output cannot sustain the family
                         as well as undertaking the caring? The need to reach these young people is so great.</p>

                    <h1>Nyaatha Ray Of Hope</h1>
                    <p>The result of the Fund is to empower the disadvantaged children
                        and give them a Ray of Hope through the education to be able to stand
                         on their own and also become a ray of hope for others. Some of the young
                          men who are now in colleges or joining colleges were street boys, and now
                          they have a Ray of Hope because of the mercy shown to them by others through
                          the support of their education.</p>
